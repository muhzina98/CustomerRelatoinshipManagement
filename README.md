# Backend Development: Customer Relationship Management System

## 1. Introduction

The goal is to build a robust, scalable, and secure backend that
supports CRM functionalities to emphasize our backend development.

## 2. Project Structure

A typical backend for a CRM project is organized for maintainability,
scalability, and clear separation of concerns. Below is an example
structure:

    crm-backend/
    │
    ├── app/
    │ ├── controllers/ # Business logic for each resource (e.g., users, clients, cases)
    │ ├── models/ # Database models (ORM/ODM schemas)
    │ ├── routes/ # API route definitions
    │ ├── middleware/ # Authentication, authorization, error handling (if required)
    │ └── services/ # External integrations, business services
    ├── config/ # Configuration files (database, environment, etc.)
    
    ├── helpers/
    ├── .env # Environment variables (never commit secrets)
    ├── package.json # Dependency manager (Node/Java/Python)
    └── index.js # Entry point

Adjust structure based on your learning outcome.

## 3. Setting Up the Environment

-   **IDE:** Use a reliable IDE like Visual Studio Code.
-   **Version Control:** Initialize a Git repository for source control.
-   **Database:** Set up a MongoDB database for development and testing.
-   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data (e.g., DB
    credentials, JWT secrets) in a `.env` file.
-   **API Testing Tools:** Use Postman for API testing and
    documentation.
-   **Dependency Installation:** Install required packages using your
    package manager (e.g., npm).

## 4. Layout

The backend exposes RESTful APIs for all core CRM functionalities. Key
modules include: - **User Authentication:** Secure login, JWT token
issuance, password hashing. - **Customer Management:** CRUD operations
for customer records. - **Case/Assignment Management:** Endpoints for
creating, updating, and tracking support cases.

## 5. Detailed Implementation Steps

### 5.1 Database Design

-   Use normalization to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity.
-   Define tables/collections for users, customers, cases
    etc.

Example: - `users`: id, username, password_hash, role
          - `customers`: id,name, contact_info, status 
          - `cases`: id, customer_id, assigned_to,priority, status, created_at

### 5.2 API Development

-   Design RESTful endpoints for all resources (e.g., `/api/customers`,
    `/api/cases`).


Base path: /api

Auth

POST /api/auth/register — register a new user

POST /api/auth/login — login and receive JWT

Customers

GET /api/customers — list all customers

POST /api/customers — create a customer

GET /api/customers/:id — get single customer

PATCH /api/customers/:id — update customer

DELETE /api/customers/:id — delete customer

Cases

GET /api/cases — list cases 

POST /api/cases — create a new case

GET /api/cases/:id — get a single case

PATCH /api/cases/:id — update a case

DELETE /api/cases/:id — delete a case


Testing

Use Postman or curl to test endpoints
